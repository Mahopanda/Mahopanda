# Hi, I'm Haruki 👋

**Full-stack · Data · AI Engineer with strong system thinking and product sense**

---

I build systems from an end-to-end perspective —  
from architecture and infrastructure, through data and reasoning flows,  
all the way to products that people actually use and rely on.

I started my career in iOS and .NET, then transitioned into machine learning and data systems.  
Along the way, I’ve built automated trading systems, AI-driven CRMs,  
and large-scale intelligent knowledge systems operating in real-world environments.

## What I focus on

- Designing intelligent systems centered on **retrieval and understanding**,  
  turning complex information into context that supports decisions and actions
- Integrating enterprise systems (such as ERP, communication, and customer service platforms),  
  allowing AI to naturally participate in real operational workflows
- Building scalable, multi-tenant services in cloud environments,  
  covering data flows, isolation, and long-term operability
- Designing and delivering **multi-agent service architectures**,  
  enabling agents with different roles and capabilities to collaborate on complex tasks

What I enjoy most is connecting abstract designs into complete, working systems —  
shaping technology into products that feel **natural, reliable, and genuinely useful**.
